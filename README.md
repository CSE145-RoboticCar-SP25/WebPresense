## About The Project
### Motivation - Why are you committing to this project?
**1. Eugenie**
  - Inspired by the robotic systems we encounter in everyday life such as autonomous vacuum cleaners, self-driving cars, and warehouse robots, we're excited to explore how these technologies are built from the ground up. This project gives us the opportunity to bridge theory with practice by integrating concepts from both our machine learning and web application development courses. We're not only interested in developing an obstacle-avoiding robot but also in enhancing it with intelligent behavior, real-time data processing, or a web-based interface for remote control. By working on this project, we aim to deepen our technical skills, understand the challenges of building smart systems, and push the boundaries of what we can create as a team.

**2. Momina**
  - I am excited to build something hands-on that combines embedded systems and robotics. I became especially interested in this topic after attending a workshop at my college where we built a basic robotic car with simple sensors. It was a great experience that introduced me to the foundations of robot design, but we didn’t have the chance to explore the AI side of things. This project gives me the opportunity to take that experience further by not only creating an obstacle-avoiding robot but also learning how to integrate smarter features like AI and intelligent navigation. I’ve always wanted to understand how autonomous systems work in the real world, and this project is a perfect way to explore how Arduino, RB5 sensors, motors, and AI can work together in real time.

**3. Emma**
  - I have always dreamed of building a robot, and this project gives me the great opportunity to bring that dream to life. By making a robotic car, I can apply my understanding and knowledge on hardware, software and AI, machine learning into a hands-on, meaningful experience. I am also lucky to have teammates that share the same passion and interest in creating a robotic car. We want to combine what we have learned to build an obstacle-avoiding robot car using AI and machine learning.

**4. Sam**
  - I am genuinely committed to this project because building a robot has been a personal goal of mine since transferring here. I also want to take what I’ve already learned from machine learning and web development to parallel computing and apply those skills to embedded hardware using the RB5 and mBot. I am excited to try adding something creative and original to the robotic car as well.
